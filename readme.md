# mattgraham93.github.io

Welcome to my repository! This is my dedicated home for all personal, professional, and academic work. All work is original and my own. 

I'm working towards my goal of using data to create beautiful visualizations that convey a meaningful story. The goal of my site and personal work (right now, at least) - is to tell the story of how we can use data to shift the mentalities of humans to focus on the greater good of the world. 

We tend to focus on our own needs and not the needs of others. I believe we can use data to imply how human beings are primitive and need a community to support them. Community support pushes self-happiness and through that, we can focus on bettering our world.

Global villages scare nationalists. I believe we, as the humans, depend on each other to evolve. I want to contribute to that cause.
