        I find it sad that it appears to be a minimum of 3.5% of the human population that is diagnosed with
        clinical depression. Let's start looking at Russia, a controversial country at this point in history.
        Russia known to be home to some of the most depressed people and this visualization supports that theory.
        What I find interesting is that China and India are also fairly low in their depression rates, seemingly
        lower than that of the Americas.

        What's important to remember is that education is more than just grade level and academia. Education is
        about emotion intelligence as well; and through that, you gain tolerance for one another. It is interesting to note
        that the United States is fairly low in its depression rate as well. I suspected our rates would be fairly
        high. I began to wonder why... my first thought - educational bureaucracy coupled with religion.

    <p class="textContentLeft">
        Why do I say religion? I made a big jump there... Let's start with the role that government plays on education and the role religion plays in governments.
        As governments play a crucial role in what people do in their day-to-day lives, most governments are in control of what their education system teaches their youth.
        That being said, in some way, religion is influenced in the education system through the vise of what the government "believes" at that time.

        Here is where it starts to get interesting. You might ask - "<i>Why is this relevant?</i>" We notice that Russia <i>and</i> China have strong restrictions
        on other religions. China is happier than Russia - why? Religion. Wait... what? How can something that separates these countries and people have such
        polarizing impacts on different people? It's the kind of religion.
    </p>
    <p class="textContentLeft">
        China's main religion is Hinduism, a religion that recognizes suffering. Russia practices Christianity, another religion that recognizes suffering.
        What's interesting is the suffering is spread differently among the two religions - Hinduism believes in "a way of life". This is understanding
        that life is as it comes. Christianity believes that everything in life is something you have earned through "God's" eyes. Hinduism belives in luck,
        and karma. Christianity believes that if you pray hard enough, something will come true. One is about all devotion to one object, the other is
        about sharing luck with others. This is where I believe we can start to differentiate a "good" religion from a "bad" religion by asking - how inclusive are we?
