            Hi there and welcome!
        </h2>
        <p class="textContentLeft bottom-shim">
            Mental health has turned into a growing passion of mine and it goes hand-in-hand with my dream of bringing data to the world. It is proven that Eastern cultures feel happier and more fulfilled in life than we do in the West.
        </p>
        <p class="textContentLeft bottom-shim">
            We have grown to be greedy, self-obsessed, and reliant on validation from others. This has been an ongoing issue - <i>especially for the white man (especially if they're christian!)</i> - and it's time for it to stop! What is happening today is out of our control. What we can do is treat each other better, everyday, by learning more about what it means to be a human.
        </p>
        <p class="textContentLeft bottom-shim">
            A lot of the data I want to consume and regurgitate revolves people who suffer from anxiety and depression. Maybe more one day, but this is where I want to start. These are two emotions I experience almost everyday and I have done a significant amount of reading on these topics. As I learn more, I want to tell people more... not just through my story, but through real, <i>HARD</i>, data analysis. I believe we can answer the "why" behind human behaviors. When we do that, we learn about what makes us tick, and through doing so, we can bring enlightenment to many.
        </p>
        <p class="textContentLeft bottom-shim">
            I believe that when we teach people empathy, we can start to open our eyes and look over one another's differences. When this is common practice, we will begin having truly free trade in hopes we become a global village and work on progressing the evolution of the human race.
        </p>
        <p class="textContentLef bottom-shim">
            As education becomes a more regular thing, we notice that people are becoming more and more depressed. Interesting how that works, huh?
